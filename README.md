# USC-CSCI-356-Computer-Information-Systems-Original-Content

I was a course producer for this course for 3 semesters. During that time, I took initiative to create detailed guides for each of the programming assignments. I posted each of these to the class's forum on Piazza, and they will be reused in future semesters.

Each of the pdfs are in this repository.
